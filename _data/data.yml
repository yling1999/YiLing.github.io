    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Hello, this is Yi Ling, a second-year MS student at the Simon Business 
        School, University of Rochester. My journey began with the Bachelor degree
        in Advertising Management from Michigan State University, followed by 
        a year of valuable experience in my hometown in China. During that time, 
        I realized the importance of acquiring essential skills and experience, 
        which led me back to graduate school. 
        
        As I near graduation, my goal is to apply the knowledge I've gained to 
        real-world challenges. With a strong foundation and a proven track record, 
        I aspire to pursue roles such as a Senior Marketing Analyst, Marketing Manager, 
        or to specialize in areas like digital marketing analytics.
