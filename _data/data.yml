    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Hello, this is Yi Ling, a second-year MS student at the Simon Business 
        School, University of Rochester. My journey began with the Bachelor degree
        in Advertising Management from Michigan State University, followed by 
        a year of valuable experience in my hometown in China. During that time, 
        I realized the importance of acquiring essential skills and experience, 
        which led me back to graduate school. 
        
        As I near graduation, my goal is to apply the knowledge I've gained to 
        real-world challenges. With a strong foundation and a proven track record, 
        I aspire to pursue roles such as a Senior Marketing Analyst, Marketing Manager, 
        or to specialize in areas like digital marketing analytics.

            "In collaboration with a team, we undertook a project for our client, Cobblestone Learning Center, 
            with the objective of enhancing student academic performance and evaluating the 
            future study projects' success. Leveraging the power of R and Tableau, I analyzed a substantial 
            dataset of 50,000+ students, resulting in a notable 6.1% improvement in overall performance, 
            while also delivering valuable recommendations for product enhancement."

            "In this project, I was part of a team working with a music record company, where my 
             responsibilities involved database analysis and generating marketing insights. We successfully 
             queried a database containing over 10,000 customer data entries, employing SQL's aggregate, 
             join, and filtering functions to derive more than five valuable marketing insights for the 
             record label. 
             Additionally, we harnessed the power of Tableau to analyze and visualize the optimized data, 
             culminating in a dynamic dashboard featuring over five visualizations to aid our client's 
             decision-making process."

            "In this project, our objective was to optimize the media utilization of Ally Online Bank 
             across both online and offline advertising channels. We began by conducting a comprehensive 
             analysis, which included a SWOT analysis, to revamp the marketing strategy. This analysis 
             led to the formulation of over five strategic recommendations, ultimately resulting in a 
             projected 30% increase in sales. Additionally, we conducted an online survey involving more 
             than 100 users and meticulously analyzed their responses using the Facebook dashboard. 
             The insights gained from this survey informed the redesign of the website's user interface 
             and user experience (UI/UX) to align with user preferences and enhance overall customer satisfaction."
